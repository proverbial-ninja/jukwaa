Jukwaa, meaning "Stage" in Swahili, is my custom-built blogging platform, spotlighting one post at a time. Crafted with AstroJS and Svelte . It's hosted on GitHub Pages with static data and doubles as my tech playground. The source code is available but will be updated only for my needs and bug fixes.
