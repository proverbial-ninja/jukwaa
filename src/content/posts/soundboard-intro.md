Before diving into full-scale development, the first step is to experiment and ensure that the core functionalities—MIDI compatibility and sound playback—can be achieved effectively. Here’s the plan for this crucial initial phase:
Understanding MIDI and Audio Playback

* **Research MIDI Protocols:** Delve into the details of MIDI, understanding how MIDI messages are structured and how different MIDI devices communicate. This includes learning about MIDI channels, messages, and control changes.
* **Explore Audio Playback:** Investigate various audio playback libraries and plugins that integrate well with Flutter. The goal is to find a solution that offers  the ability to add audio effects.



This experimentation phase is just the beginning. Once we ensure that MIDI input and sound playback work effectively, the next steps will involve designing a user-friendly interface, implementing advanced features, and expanding the soundboard capabilities.
