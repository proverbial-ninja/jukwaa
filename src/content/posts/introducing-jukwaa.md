Welcome to Jukwaa, my shiny new blogging platform tailored to fit my whimsical needs. If you're wondering,  "Jukwaa" means "Stage" in Swahili. Yes, it's quite fitting since this blog highlights just one post at a time, giving it the spotlight it deserves—like a solo performer on a stage.


#### Why Jukwaa?

You might be thinking, "Why go through the trouble of building yet another blogging platform?" Well, for starters, I wanted to play around with Astro, and I didn’t have a current project. Enter Jukwaa—a perfect excuse to dive into AstroJS and Svelte components. Plus, there's something satisfying about creating something exactly the way you want it. No bloated features, no unnecessary plugins—just pure, customized blogging bliss.

#### Post Types

Jukwaa currently supports three types of posts:

1. [Tiktok](?post=nakupenda-whatnot) – Because who doesn’t want to embed their latest 15-second dance craze?
2. [Blog](#) – For those longer, more thoughtful posts that demand a few extra minutes of your attention. Like what you are reading.
3. [Micro Post](?post=jukwaa-update-1) – Quick thoughts, links, and musings that are  too short for a full blog post.


#### Under the Hood

Jukwaa is built with AstroJS and Svelte components. All the data is static and hosted on GitHub Pages. It's as simple and lightweight as possible, because why overcomplicate things?

#### Source Code Availability

For the curious and the brave, the source code is available. However, don’t expect frequent updates or new features. I’ll maintain it for my own needs and fix any bugs that might crop up, but that's about it. After all, this is my stage, and I like to keep things manageable.

So, there you have it. Jukwaa, my custom-built stage for blogging. Will it stand the test of time? Who knows. But for now, it’s here, and it's mine.

Stay tuned for the next post, whenever inspiration strikes. And if it doesn’t, well, you can always revisit this one—it’s not going anywhere.
